This package helps to retrieve SourceForge site information
in a perl script.

So far, can only get very basic information. The goal is to be able
to fetch Tracker and Mailing list data. Please send any suggestions
directly to me.

Use at your own risk, the author is not responsible to any damage
caused by using this package.

Cheers,
